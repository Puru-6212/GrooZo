GrooZo – Refund Policy
Last Updated: 04-12-2025

At GrooZo, we aim to provide the best food delivery experience. This Refund Policy explains how refund requests are evaluated and processed.

1. Eligible Refund Cases
  A refund may be approved only under the following circumstances:
  - Wrong item delivered
  - Severely damaged or very poor packaging
  - Genuine issues verified by the admin and restaurant (e.g., missing items, completely incorrect order)
  Note - Refunds are not provided for:
  - Taste preferences
  - Quantity dissatisfaction (unless entirely missing)
  - Personal dislikes after ordering

2. Refund Request Process
  1. User files a refund request through the GrooZo app. 
  2. Admin reviews the request first.
     - If the admin finds the case valid, it is forwarded to the restaurant. 
     - If found invalid, the request is rejected at this stage.
  3. Restaurant verification.
     - The restaurant must confirm the issue with proper justification.
  4. Final approval and refund.
     - Once the restaurant confirms and the admin validates the justification, the refund is approved and initiated.
  GrooZo may request photos, videos, or brief evidence to validate the claim.

3. Refund Method & Timeline
  - For online payments, refunds are processed to the original payment method.
  - For Cash on Delivery, refund (if applicable) will be issued through a digital mode (UPI/bank transfer).
  - Refund initiation time: 1–3 working days after approval.
  - Bank processing time: 3–7 working days depending on the provider.

4. Non-Refundable Situations
  A refund will not be granted if:
  - The user reports the issue much later after delivery without valid proof.
  - The food has been consumed substantially.
  - The complaint is based only on taste, spice level, or portion expectations.

5. Final Decision
  - GrooZo and the restaurant reserve the right to make the final decision on refund eligibility after reviewing the request, evidence, and order details.
